				<h4>Matthew 18</h4>
				<p>If you witness a friend, roommate, or other community member violating PBA policy, you have the ability to confront them, and hae that converstaion as peers. Always start there unless the violation goes against federal or state law, or if it causes danger or harm to someone. In those cases, please have a conversation with a member of the Residence Life Staff.</p>

				<h4>Amnesty</h4>
				<p>Struggling with something and want help? Request amnesty by talking with your RD about what that process looks like for things like alcohol use, substance use, sexual relationships, or any behaviour that conflicts with PBA community standards. You don't need to struggle alone. We want to walk with you along the way.</p>
